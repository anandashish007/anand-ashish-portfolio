    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a heart full of ambition and a mind wired for logic.
      From the first line of code I wrote, I felt drawn to the world of software and innovation.
      I believe technology is not just about machines, but about shaping a better future for people.
      My goal is to become a successful software engineer who creates meaningful and efficient solutions.
      I am constantly learning new programming languages and improving my problem-solving skills.
      Challenges motivate me, and failures teach me lessons that push me forward.
      I know that consistency and discipline are the true keys to achievement.
      Every day, I work harder to strengthen my technical and analytical abilities.
      I dream of contributing to real-world projects that make life smarter and simpler.
      One day, I will proudly stand as a software engineer who turned dreams into reality.
