    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p class="about-text">
      I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a heart full of ambition and a mind wired for logic.

      From the first line of code I wrote, I felt drawn to the world of software and innovation.

      I believe technology is not just about machines, but about shaping a better future for people.

      My goal is to become a successful software engineer who creates meaningful and efficient solutions.

      I am constantly learning new programming languages and improving my problem-solving skills.

      Challenges motivate me, and failures teach me lessons that push me forward.

      I know that consistency and discipline are the true keys to achievement.

      Every day, I work harder to strengthen my technical and analytical abilities.

      I dream of contributing to real-world projects that make life smarter and simpler.

      Time management and self-improvement guide my daily routine.

      I aim to balance knowledge with creativity and logic with innovation.

      My journey may be demanding, but my determination is stronger.

      I trust the process and believe in steady growth.

      With passion and perseverance, I am shaping my future step by step.

      One day, I will proudly stand as a software engineer who turned dreams into reality.
