    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p class="about-text">
      I am a Computer Science and Engineering student with a heart full of ambition
      and a mind wired for logic. From the first line of code I wrote, I felt drawn
      to the world of software and innovation.

      I believe technology is not just about machines, but about shaping a better
      future for people. My goal is to become a successful software engineer who
      creates meaningful and efficient solutions.

      I am constantly learning new programming languages and improving my
      problem-solving skills. Challenges motivate me, and failures teach me lessons
      that push me forward.

      I know that consistency and discipline are the true keys to achievement.
      Every day, I work harder to strengthen my technical and analytical abilities.

      I dream of contributing to real-world projects that make life smarter and
      simpler. One day, I will proudly stand as a software engineer who turned
      dreams into reality.
