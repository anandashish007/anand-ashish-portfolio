    <p class="about-text">
      'I am a dedicated Computer Science Engineering student with a strong academic background and a clear professional vision. 
      My educational journey began at Sidhartha Vidyalaya, where I completed my 10th-grade studies during the 2020–2021 academic year, achieving a distinguished 95% pass percentage. This early success laid a solid foundation for my analytical and technical interests.
      Following my secondary education, I joined Sri Chaitanya Junior College for my intermediate studies, which I successfully completed in 2023. This period was instrumental in sharpening my mathematical and scientific reasoning, ultimately leading me to pursue a career in technology.
      Currently, I am a student at the Eluru College of Engineering and Technology, specializing in Computer Science Engineering. In this environment, I am actively honing my technical skills and building a deep understanding of software systems. My ultimate career goal is to become a Software Engineer, a role where I can apply my problem-solving abilities and engineering knowledge to create innovative software solutions and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry."
